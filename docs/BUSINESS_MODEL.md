## The 3 Viable Solo Business Models

### 1. Vertical SaaS Autopilot

**Target**: One industry you understand deeply (dentists, law firms, HVAC, real estate)

**What you build**:
- 5 automations every business in that vertical needs
- Templated with minor config changes per client

**Example automations**:
1. Lead qualification from website forms
2. Appointment reminder sequences  
3. Review request automation
4. Invoice follow-up
5. Referral tracking

**Pricing**:
| Tier | Price | Includes |
|------|-------|----------|
| Starter | $500/month | 2 automations |
| Growth | $1,000/month | 4 automations |
| Pro | $2,000/month | All 5 + priority support |

**Revenue target**: 10-15 clients = $60,000 - $240,000/year

**Why it works solo**: 
- Same template, minor config
- Shared knowledge base
- Predictable support load

### 2. Agency Process Replacement

**Target**: Marketing/sales agencies drowning in manual work

**What you automate**:
- Client report generation
- Campaign performance monitoring
- Lead enrichment pipelines
- Proposal assembly
- Client onboarding flows

**Pricing**:
| Model | Price |
|-------|-------|
| Rev share | 10-20% of time saved |
| Flat fee | $3,000 - $8,000/month |

**Why it works solo**:
- Agencies have budget
- Clear ROI calculation
- Long-term contracts

---

### 3. Internal Tools for Non-Tech Companies

**Target**: Growing companies (50-500 employees) without dev teams

**What you build**:
- Sales rep research assistant
- Customer support ticket classifier
- Compliance document analyzer
- Inventory anomaly detector
- Custom "copilots" for specific roles

**Pricing**:
| Component | Price |
|-----------|-------|
| Build | $10,000 - $50,000 one-time |
| Maintenance | $2,000/month |

**Why it works solo**:
- High-ticket = fewer clients needed
- Deep relationship = low churn
- Referral potential

## Choosing Your Model

| Factor | Vertical SaaS | Agency | Internal Tools |
|--------|---------------|--------|----------------|
| Sales complexity | Low | Medium | High |
| Onboarding time | Hours | Days | Weeks |
| Revenue per client | $500-2k/mo | $3-8k/mo | $10-50k + $2k/mo |
| Clients needed for $100k | 8-15 | 2-3 | 2-3 |
| Support load | Low | Medium | Medium |
| Moat | Vertical expertise | Agency relationships | Institutional knowledge |

**Recommendation for first year**: Start with **Vertical SaaS Autopilot**
- Fastest to first revenue
- Forces you to templatize
- Builds case studies for other models

## Pricing Philosophy

### Don't price by hours — price by value

Bad: "I charge $150/hour"  
Good: "This automation saves you 15 hours/week. That's $X/year in labor costs."

### The 10x rule

Your automation should save the client 10x what they pay you.

Example:
- Automation saves 10 hours/week × $50/hour = $500/week = $26,000/year
- You charge: $2,000/month = $24,000/year
- ROI: 10% of their savings — easy yes

### Never compete on price

If a client wants the cheapest option, they don't understand the value.

Move on.

## Client Limits (Solo Reality Check)

| Limit | Maximum | Why |
|-------|---------|-----|
| Concurrent clients | 10-15 | Support + maintenance overhead |
| Automations per client | 3-5 | Complexity ceiling |
| New clients per month | 2-3 | Onboarding bandwidth |

**Exceeding these limits = burnout or quality collapse.**

When you hit the ceiling:
1. Raise prices
2. Templatize harder
3. Fire lowest-value clients
4. Consider first hire
